// Node.js
//
// An open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

// Under the hood
//
// Runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser
// JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution
// A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request
// WebAssembly, a high-performance language that can be compiled from various languages, is also supported

// Asynchronous Programming
//
// JavaScript is single threaded (cannot run in parallel) and synchronous by default
// At its core, JavaScript is designed to be non-blocking on the "main" thread
//
// Node.js also provides a non-blocking I/O environment to file access, network calls and so on
